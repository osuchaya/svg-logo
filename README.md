## Description

This project is part of module 10 on Object-Orientated Programming where the author has to use Command Line Interface (CLI) with Node.js and inquirer package to dynamically generate a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) logo by prompting the user to input information required to generate desired logo designs. There are limited options to generate the logo.


## Installation

Install Node version 16.0 in order to run this application successfully.

## Usage

After cloning the code files into local machine, run  node index.js. This will initiate the prompts to input information required to generate a basic SVG logo. Follow the prompts and answer all the questions. Once completed, a logo.svg file will be generated, with features i.e. shape, color and letters matching the information the user has put in.

## Learning points
The author learned to apply what is learnt during Node.js and Object-Orientated Programming module and executing JavaScript functions through Command Line Interface. 
Through this exercise, the author also learned to use node package manager (npm) to install inquirer and use inquirer function to ask for
user input. Other useful functions such as writeToFile, OOP inheritance (extends) and path to store the file generated is also implemented in this project. It has
been a very useful introductory project to the back-end environment for my web development course.

## Credits
Resources were consulted to complete this application. This includes documents about Node.js, Inquirer package from npm and tutorials on SVG from https://nodejs.org, https://npmjs.com (relevant version), Mozilla https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial and tutor who helped to explain the concepts on file structures, SVG polygons and render functions.
